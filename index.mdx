## What is a hosted KYC session?

A hosted session is a short‑lived record that gives you a `verificationUrl` to send users through a secure identity verification flow. You create the session with your public API key and optionally include a `redirectUrl` and `metadata` to track your users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a session">
    POST `/v1/kyc/sessions` with your Bearer public API key. Response includes `sessionId` and `verificationUrl`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send user to verificationUrl">
    The hosted UI collects document and facial biometrics securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve the session">
    GET `/v1/kyc/sessions/{sessionId}` to check ownership and status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle results">
    The hosted UI triggers a server action to produce a verdict. Store outcomes in your backend if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

Use your public API key in the Authorization header. Keys map to users in Firestore under `users.apiPublicKey`.

```http
Authorization: Bearer pb-YourPublicKey
```

## Hosts and security

Requests are served only on allowed hosts: `api.verisecid.com`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`. Override with `API_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma‑separated). Disallowed hosts return `404` with `{ "error": "invalid_host" }`.

## Endpoints

- Create session: `POST /v1/kyc/sessions`
- Get session: `GET /v1/kyc/sessions/{sessionId}`
