<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 19 or higher
  - A docs repository with a `docs.json` file
  - A VerisecID public API key (e.g., `pb-xxxxx`)
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```
</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Hosts and CORS

API requests are served only when the Host header matches an allowlist.

Default allowed hosts:

- `api.verisecid.com`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`

Override with env var:

```bash
API_ALLOWED_HOSTS=api.verisecid.com,localhost,127.0.0.1
```

When a host is not allowed, handlers return `404` with `{ "error": "invalid_host" }`.

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Authentication

Pass your public key as a Bearer token. Keys map to users in Firestore under `users.apiPublicKey`.

```http
Authorization: Bearer pb-YourPublicKey
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Environment variables

- `API_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (optional) — comma-separated hostnames allowed for `/api/*`.
- Firebase client (for app UI) requires standard `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables.
- Server-side verification actions may require AI provider keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

## Session lifecycle

- Initial: `not_started`
- Typical progression: `not_started` → `processing` → `completed` (or `failed`)
- Verify UI prevents reuse when `status === "completed"`.

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
