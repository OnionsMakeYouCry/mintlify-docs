## Get started in three steps

Spin up a hosted KYC verification session and load the Verify flow.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    
    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Authentication">
    Use your public API key in the `Authorization` header.

    ```http
    Authorization: Bearer pb-YourPublicKey
    ```

    Public keys map to users in Firestore under `users.apiPublicKey`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Create a hosted session

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="cURL example">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.verisecid.com/api/v1/kyc/sessions" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer pb-YourPublicKey" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "redirectUrl": "https://yourapp.com/kyc/return",
        "metadata": { "customerId": "12345" }
      }'
    ```

    Successful response includes `sessionId` and `verificationUrl`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Retrieve a session

<Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="cURL example">
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "https://api.verisecid.com/api/v1/kyc/sessions/SESSION_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer pb-YourPublicKey"
  ```

  - 403 when requesting user doesn't own the session/workspace
  - 404 when the session doesn't exist
</Accordion>
